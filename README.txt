Sample inputs: 
First when you run Triple_A_main.py it will present to you a menu.
You have to select either 1, 2 or 3 according to the respective option.


Now enter your name it can be any string we would recommend not having # in you name
It will not cause any exceptions but it will cause a logical error.


Instead of mentioning sample inputs i will explain the game
So the game start by selecting some category from which data will be taken
There are 3 options bollywood movie, IMDB movie or Anime to choose from to pick any one enter either 1, 2 or 3 respectively.


Now the game has begun
The user has to enter only one ALPHABET from the keyboard
The aim is to guess an alphabet that may lie in the name of the movie/anime title.
User can also gues the whole title name in one go by writing the whole title with correct spelling and format.


User can also ask for hints by typing the word ‘hint’ instead of any alphabet and it will display a hint before the hangman character.
There are limited hints 4 for bollywood and 2 for IMDB and anime
Using hint again and again will just print the ending hint.


Here after you guess a word or not guess it you can choose to play another round or stop by choosing y or n respectively.


If you choose n your score and datetime will be printed and recorded in logs.txt
